# expense-tracker-new

This is my version of the [Expense Tracker from Traversy Media's YouTube course](https://github.com/bradtraversy/expense-tracker-react), remade from scratch, and refactored to use Vercel serverless API routes, instead of Express.

The app uses React Context and Hooks, and I decided to use Material UI for styling. There are other minor tweaks, as well.

# Prerequisites
