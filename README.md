# expense-tracker-new

This is my version of the [Expense Tracker from Traversy Media's YouTube course](https://github.com/bradtraversy/expense-tracker-react), remade from scratch.

The app uses React Context and Hooks, and I decided to use Material UI for styling. There are other minor tweaks, as well, including a different server directory structure that came from `express-generator`.

# Install

`yarn && yarn run client-install`

# Config

Add a `.env` file in the `config` folder that includes a `MONGODB_URI` value.

# Dev

`yarn run dev` runs the server and the client using `concurrently`.
