# expense-tracker-new

This is my version of the [Expense Tracker from Traversy Media's YouTube course](https://github.com/bradtraversy/expense-tracker-react), remade from scratch. My first version (following that course) [is located here](https://github.com/claudiorivera/expense-tracker)

This time around, I decided to use Material UI. I also opted for a slightly different backend folder structure, beginning with an express-generator template.

# Install

`yarn && yarn run client-install`

# Config

Add a `.env` file in the `config` folder that includes a `MONGODB_URI` value.

# Dev

`yarn run dev` runs the server and the client using `concurrently`.
