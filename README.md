# expense-tracker-new

This is the Expense Tracker from Traversy Media's YouTube course, remade from scratch.

This time, I decided to use Material UI. I also opted for a slightly different backend folder structure, beginning with an express-generator template.

# Install

`yarn && yarn run client-install`

# Config

Add a `.env` file in the `config` folder that includes a `MONGODB_URI` value.

# Dev

`yarn run dev` runs the server and the client using `concurrently`.
